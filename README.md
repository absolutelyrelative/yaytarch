# yaytarch
Yet Another YouTube Archival (tool)

Yaytarch is a local library tool that allows you to watch content which you downloaded, locally from your browser.
It tries to fill a big gap of low resource intensive media libraries, and the use case is to bring my disorder of downloaded videos and playlists to an neat end. 

It is a yt-dlp frontend built with python & flask and it allows you to:

- Download and update videos from the browser or CLI
- Download and update playlists from the browser or CLI
- Browse and watch videos
- Create local collections of videos
- (Soon) import local videos!
